                <p>"I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out ok."</p>
                <p>"I do not adopt softness towards others because I want to make them better."</p>
                <p>"You can build your own things that other people can use. And once you learn that, you’ll never be the same again."</p>
                <p>"I always advise people – Don’t wait! Do something when you are young, when you have nothing to lose, and keep that in mind."</p>
                <p>"We he had everything to gain. And we figured even if we crash and burn, and lose everything, the experience will have been worth ten times the cost."</p>
                <p>"The most precious thing that we all have with us is time."</p>
                <p>"On the blue box: That was what we learned: was that us, too, we didn’t know much. We could build a little thing that could control a giant thing and that was an incredible lesson."</p>
                <p>People who know what they’re talking about don’t need PowerPoint.</p>
                <p>"Let’s go invent tomorrow rather than worrying about what happened yesterday."</p>
                <p>"The doers are the major thinkers. The people that really create the things that change this industry are both the thinker and doer in one person."</p>
                <p>"Once you discover one simple fact, and that is everything around you that you call life, was made up by people that were no smarter than you."</p>
                <p>"That’s why we started Apple, we said you know, we have absolutely nothing to lose. I was 20 years old at the time, Woz was 24-25, so we have nothing to lose. We have no families, no children, no houses. Woz had an old car. I had a Volkswagen van, I mean, all we were going to lose is our cars and the shirts off our back."</p>
                <p>"That’s been one of my mantras – focus and simplicity."</p>
                <p>"The broader one’s understanding of the human experience, the better design we will have."</p>
                <p>It’s more fun to be a pirate than to join the Navy.</p>
