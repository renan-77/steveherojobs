                <h3>JOBS, THE HERO.</h3>
                <p>Charismatic attitude, passionate demeanor, risk-taking temperament, and non-traditional conducts define 
                        Steve Jobs’ personality who lived from 24 February 1955 to 5 October 2011.</p>
                            <p>His work has often exhibited his fidelity towards his work. We all are well conversant with his 
                                potentialities in his domain and believe it or not, an individual’s conducts in his professional 
                                life exhibit a lot about the traits his personality has. Steve Jobs’ personality type is ENTJ.
                                 This type of personality people are born leaders.</p>
                                 <p>Often heard that Steve Jobs had such a rude and abrasive personality trait that he would yell
                                      at his colleagues and team anytime if things didn’t go well or according to his expectations.
                                       There have been a lot of instances where he embarrassed people in interviews. If things are not
                                        of his standards, he will leave it. Be it a hotel or anything else.  He believed that anyone can
                                         tell him that he is full of shit and vice-versa. His cantankerous nature has led the creator of
                                          the outstanding retail stores; Rob Johnson and the vice president of Global Marketing leave 
                                          their respective positions. There is always something positive in everything, and maybe this 
                                          personality trait of Steve Jobs made him what we know him for today because had he allowed others’
                                           influence on his vision, he might not have become the Steve Jobs we all admire.
                                        </p> 
                                        <p>Steve Jobs was known for rebellion, his vision, and his creativity. But most of all, the name Steve 
                                            Jobs became almost synonymous with innovation. To see an Apple product is to see the results of Jobs'
                                             thoughtful drive. Some notable quotes from this master of innovation tell us how thoughts become things.
                                              Jobs showed the world that truly valuable innovation starts first with a belief, which then frames a
                                               perspective, which then inspires an idea, which eventually becomes a tangible reality. Jobs' beliefs 
                                               can be adopted and adapted by anyone who strives to be a true master of innovation as well.</p>

                        <h3>JOBS, THE VILLAIN.</h3>
                        <p>Steve Jobs fathered a child when he was just 23. But he spent years denying that he was the father, 
                                going so far as to swear in a court document he was, "sterile and infertile, and as a result thereof, 
                                did not have the physical capacity to procreate a child." That was not true, obviously. When he was 
                                becoming rich from Apple, the mother of his daughter was going on welfare. However, later acknowledged 
                                he was in the wrong, and became closer with his daughter.  </p>
                                <p>He would harass people interviewing for work. "How old were you when you lost your virginity?" he asked. 
                                        The candidate looked baffled. “What did you say?” “Are you a virgin?” Jobs asked. The candidate sat there 
                                        flustered, so Jobs changed the subject. “How many times have you taken LSD?” Hertzfeld recalled, “The poor
                                         guy was turning varying shades of red, so I tried to change the subject and asked a straightforward technical
                                          question.” But when the candidate droned on in his response, Jobs broke in. “Gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble,”
                                           he said, cracking up Smith and Hertzfeld. “I guess I’m not the right guy,” the poor man said as he got up to leave.</p>
                                <p>He short-changed his best friend on a bonus. While working at Atari, Jobs recruited Wozniak's help to
                                     build a scaled down version of Pong. There was a big bonus involved in getting it done quickly and 
                                     efficiently, and Jobs lied about how much money was involved, pocketing the majority of the money for himself.</p>
                                <p>He was rude and cruel with people, for instance, The Xerox Star was supposed to be the hot new computer 
                                        that came out in 1981 (it was ultimately a flop). Jobs and his team went to go check it out, but were 
                                        absolutely unimpressed. A few weeks later he called Bob Belleville telling him how bad he was and offering 
                                        a job with him , one of the hardware designers on the Xerox Star team. "Everything you've ever done in your
                                         life is shit," Jobs said, "so why don't you come work for me?" </p>

        <div class="textC">
                <p>Even with the opinions divided it's right and easy to say that Jobs has a huge popularity throughout the world even after his
                    death his name is still a synonym of creativity as this website believes or even of plagiarism as other people say, in this
                website you will be able to know some more facts about him and his life, career, problems and some other things that were part of
            this incredible mind. Something that everybody agree is that Jobs had the skill of manipulation through his own methods he was capable
        to make people think in the same way as him or the way that he wanted them to think. This skill was the most critical one that lead him
    to the success. </p>
